## Motivations

Since I was young, I’ve always been the kind of guy that needed to know what the longest river in the world was, or what the population of Milan was. I’ve always sought for answers that came from data, and that necessity keeps growing in me. In the past couple of decades we entered the age of data. Advancement in sensors technology, the creation of the internet and social networks skyrocketed the amount of data we produce everyday. What’s in that data though? My belief is that there are a lot of answers there. Can we recognize pedestrian intentions and make autonomous cars extremely reliable? Yes. Can we invest more wisely? Yes. Can we automatically recognize different types of waste and improve our overall recycling rates? Yes. 

Data is useful if someone analyzes it and learn something from it, otherwise it’s just electricity and environmental costs. Recent development in the field of computer vision and machine learning makes this period super fascinating for people like me. What drives me is the belief that data can be used to make better decisions, which can lead to financial returns, but most importantly to strong impacts on our society and the world we live in.
