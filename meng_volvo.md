The research project was aimed at predicting the intention of a pedestrian to cross or not cross the road. This project was a successful attempt to emulate the behaviour of a human driver to guess the intention of fellow road users such as pedestrians. Our team based the approach on a research paper that had some work in this area. After replicating the
