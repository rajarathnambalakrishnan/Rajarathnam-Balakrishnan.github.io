**Project description:** 
<br>

The XRP Ledger is a blockchain network full of rich transaction activity. Blockchain technologies have erupted in the past decade. The potential use cases have been enumerated by many tech pundits, but few technologies have actually matured and become mainstays of the ecosystem in which they were made. Ripple, the creator of the XRP Ledger, has the goal of making global transaction payments and settlements seamless. The ledger network which they operate has millions of dollars transacted every day. 

One of the benefits of blockchain is anonymity for its users of the network, making it hacker, and tampering secure. However, as an operator of the network, Ripple struggles to maintain the health of a distributed network and drive user-centric product development with limited knowledge of its users.

The aim of this project is four-fold: to provide Ripple with an anomaly detection tool to enable quick reaction to and investigation of events on the XRP Ledger, to understand the main drivers of XRP's price, to segment customer archetypes based on their activity on the XRP ledger, and finally to identify and remove fake volume payments.
