**Project description:** 
<br>
Vision based autonomous driving assistance systems have been highly successful due to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Learning approaches. The main objective of this project was to understand the state of the art field of Deep Learning in Image processing tasks for autonomous driving sytems through a hands-on project. In essence, our team utilized this opportunity to learn

The figure below shows the user interface we created for this project. Here are shown the computed path between two chosen points A and B, altitudes graph, and the drone's battery percentage. Finally, in the bottom right corner are shown some path's features: time, total space (every cell correspond to 5 meters), number of cells and maximum altitude. The text below alerts the user with
some important messages, for example, when the chosen points are not valid or a power recharge is necessary.
