# About Me

I recieved my B.Tech Undergrad degree in Mechanical Engineering from SRM Institue of Science and Technology, Chennai, India. If you had asked me: What was the reason/motivation to do a 4 year degree in Mechanical Engineering ?, then I would have said that I wanted to build an Iron Man Suit. Yes, you heard it right. Tony Stark's Mark 42 Autonomous Prehensile Propulsion Suit. Funny right? But, I was devoted to the cause, and dreamt of building something even close to it if not the same. As all dreams get a reality check, I found out the hard way that it was not that easy to build something to that size given the power and force requirement. But the dream to build something unique and marvellous stayed on. Fast forward and I finished my undergrad with focus on Operations Research and Data Analysis. I was introduced to the world of Data Science through IBM's Data Science 101 course and then the search began.
