# About Me
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Before we start let me just list the things I'm confident and good at: drawing, painting, table-tennis, cooking, video-editing and well let me stop while I'm ahead!

I recieved my B.Tech Undergrad degree in Mechanical Engineering from SRM Institue of Science and Technology, Chennai, India. If you had asked me back then: What was the reason/motivation to do a 4 year degree in Mechanical Engineering ?, then I would have said that I wanted to build an Iron Man Suit. Yes, you heard it right. Tony Stark's Mark 42 Autonomous Prehensile Propulsion Suit. Funny right? But, I was devoted to the cause, and dreamt of building something even close to it if not the same. As all dreams get a reality check, I found out the hard way that it was not that easy to build something to that size given the power and force/strength requirements. But the dream to build something unique and marvellous stayed on. Fast forward and I finished my undergrad with focus on Operations Research and Data Analysis.

I was introduced to the world of Data Science through IBM's Data Science 101 online course. With this course I was interested to know more about Data Science and Machine Learning, which led to my enrollement in 6+ months of a Data Scientist Online Certification Course by UpX and Tech Mahindra. This 8 month long course introduced me to the basics of Data Science such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Data visualization using Tableau to Machine Learning concepts from introduction to advanced alogrithms and techniques. The course was taught by many industry practioners in different domains from Finance to Retail. This experience was instrumental for my decision to explore more of this field and led to my application for Masters study in the USA. My application for UC Berkeley was accepted and I started my Master of Engineering in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (Data Analytics and Machine Learning Track).

Part of my MEng degree involved a year long Capstone project. I and three other MEng students were part of project on Image Recognition for Autonomous Driving
