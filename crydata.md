**Project description:** 
<br>
**Problem**<br>
Cryptocurrencies’ price has so far been highly volatile and unpredictable, leading to either large profits or large losses. Trading volume has often been correlated to price movements, but this superficial correlation can easily be biased by big players moving large quantities of money back and forth from their accounts. This trading volume is often referred to as “fake volume” and it is easy to understand how it is not significant in assessing cryptocurrencies’ value. Are there other signals that can be used to predict what the price of a particular cryptocurrency will be in the future? 
<br>
**Solution**<br>
Gathering data related to different cryptocurrencies from different online sources, which could be used to study price correlations and build investment strategies.
<br>
**Value proposition**<br>
Data is currently largely dispersed around the web, and valuable information has to be accessed from several different sources, cleaned, and organized before someone can analyze it. At present, some startups offer similar solutions, and require you to pay to access them. These datasets usually contain information about historical price and volume, but don’t take into consideration fake volume, social media interest, or search engine queries. While it’s very hard to accurately assess the size of fake volume, social engagement over time might signal the existence of some red flags.
